# Config

## Parcel
Planter Basic uses [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/), a zero config build tool. This means it handles most things like support for Sass, JS, TypeScript, React, and more right out of the box. Check out the [Parcel Docs](https://parceljs.org/docs/) to learn more about how to change the configuration of your project.

## Linters
We included linters to serve as a starting point for implementing your own rules. The default rules are based on our Ditto code style guide.

## `.eslintrc.js`
By default, ESLint can only be run manually via the `lint:js` script.

## `.stylelintrc.js`
By default, StyleLint can only be run manually via the `lint:css` script. Read more about [Stylelint](https://stylelint.io/user-guide/configure).
